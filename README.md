# Platts_AAP_CW

The aim of this coursework was to implement a utility plugin that could implement mid-side encoding and decoding as well as having a parameter for adjusting the stereo width of a signal.

The core task consisted of developing a code that could encode and decode stereo and mid-side inputs for stereo and mid-side outputs. 
This was implemented using the correct equations that could perform the desired function on the signals that was appropriate for the task.

The development of the plugin also consisted of implementing appropriate user interface controls to allow clear manipulation of the algorithm.

An advanced task was issued that consisted of developing the plugin by adding more features. As this was a stereo/MS plugin I decided to add features that would be commonly found of a plugin of this type
These include; Mid and side inversion, mid and side gain as well as a swap channels feature. 

Throughout the CW correct version control was undertaken highlighting changes to the code as progress was made. This was documented in the github repository.
